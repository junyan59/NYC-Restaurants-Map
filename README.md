## New York Restaurants Map

### Project Description
* The map features a Model–View–ViewModel(MVVM) design pattern, Knockout JavaScript framework to provide users with a highly responsive and interactive web interface.
* Implement a list view of the set of locations. Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load. The list view and the markers update accordingly using knockout framework.
* Add functionality using Foursqaure (third-party API) to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked using Jquery AJAX. You can click the link provided in the marker's info window to visit the restaurant website.
* Add google street view image of each location using google map APIs.
* Add functionality to animate a map marker when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.
* Add functionality to open an infoWindow when either a location is selected from the list.
* Responsive design giving the ability to be used and viewed on multiple devices.
* The app's interface is intuitive to use. For example, the input text area to filter locations is easy to locate.
* All data APIs load asynchronously and errors are handled gracefully.
